## Conference assumptions:

1. The conference lasts for one day: June 1, 2021.
2. It starts at 10:00 am and ends at 3:45 pm.
3. Each lecture lasts 1h 45m (15 minutes is a coffee break):
- the first lecture starts at 10:00 and lasts until 11:45.
- the second one starts at 12:00 and ends at 13:45
- the third one starts at 2 p.m. and ends at 3:45 p.m.
4. As part of the conference, 3 different thematic paths run in parallel are supported. If the user subscribes to a given path for a given time, then he can no longer attend a different path in that period, and at a different time he can choose a different path.
5. Each lecture can accommodate a maximum of 5 listeners.

## Functions:
